# Hi there, I'm Zachary White 👋

Welcome to my profile! I am working towards my Bachelors degree in Software Development at Bellevue University.

This is where I will post things only related to coursework, I plan on working more exclusively on this profile.
Moving forward, as this will serve as both my professional and educational spot for all things software related.
